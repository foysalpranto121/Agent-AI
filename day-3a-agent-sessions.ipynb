It's an exciting time for AI in healthcare, with the potential to truly transform patient care and medical research.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Are there any new developments in drug discovery?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Yes, absolutely! Drug discovery is one of the areas where AI is making the most significant and rapidly evolving impact. Here are some of the key new developments and ongoing trends in AI-driven drug discovery:\n\n**1. Generative AI for Novel Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **De Novo Design:** This is a hot area. Generative AI models (like GANs, VAEs, and transformer-based models) are being used to design entirely new molecules from scratch that have specific desired properties. Instead of screening existing libraries, AI can *create* molecules optimized for binding to a target, solubility, or other therapeutic criteria.\n*   **\"Drug-like\" Properties:** These models are trained on vast datasets of known drugs and chemical compounds to learn what makes a molecule \"drug-like\" and improve its chances of success in preclinical and clinical trials.\n*   **Examples:** Companies are using this to discover novel antibiotics, anti-cancer agents, and treatments for rare diseases.\n\n**2. AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** AI is helping researchers identify and understand complex biological targets that were previously considered \"undruggable\" due to their structure or function. By analyzing genomic, proteomic, and clinical data, AI can pinpoint novel therapeutic targets.\n*   **Disease Pathway Analysis:** AI can map out intricate disease pathways and identify critical nodes or proteins within these pathways that, if modulated, could effectively treat the disease.\n\n**3. Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity:**\n\n*   **In Silico Screening:** AI models can predict how well a potential drug will bind to its target and its likely efficacy *in silico* (using computer simulations) before costly and time-consuming laboratory experiments.\n*   **Toxicity Prediction:** Critically, AI can also predict potential toxic side effects of drug candidates early in the discovery process, saving resources and reducing the risk of late-stage failures. This involves analyzing large datasets of known drug toxicities and their chemical structures.\n\n**4. Accelerating Preclinical Testing:**\n\n*   **Biomarker Discovery:** AI can identify biomarkers that indicate a drug's effectiveness or a patient's likelihood of responding to a treatment.\n*   **Optimizing Experimental Design:** AI can help researchers design more efficient and informative preclinical experiments.\n\n**5. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**\n\n*   **Finding New Uses:** AI algorithms can analyze vast databases of drug information, scientific literature, and patient data to identify existing approved drugs that could be effective for treating new diseases. This significantly shortens the development timeline as the safety profile of these drugs is already established.\n\n**6. Personalized Drug Development:**\n\n*   **Patient Stratification:** AI can analyze patient data to identify subgroups of patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular drug, leading to more targeted clinical trials and ultimately, personalized treatments.\n\n**Key Companies and Research Efforts to Watch:**\n\n*   **Big Pharma:** Many large pharmaceutical companies (e.g., Pfizer, Novartis, AstraZeneca, Merck) have dedicated AI/ML teams and partnerships with AI drug discovery startups.\n*   **AI-Native Drug Discovery Companies:** Companies like Atomwise, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, Insilico Medicine, BenevolentAI, and Schrödinger are at the forefront of this field.\n*   **Academic Collaborations:** Universities and research institutions are heavily involved in developing and applying AI for drug discovery.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite the incredible progress, challenges persist, including:\n\n*   **Data Quality and Accessibility:** High-quality, curated biological and chemical data is essential for training robust AI models.\n*   **Model Interpretability:** Understanding *why* an AI model predicts a certain outcome is crucial for building trust and guiding further research.\n*   **Experimental Validation:** AI predictions must always be rigorously validated through laboratory experiments.\n*   **Regulatory Hurdles:** Navigating the regulatory pathway for AI-discovered drugs is an evolving process.\n\nIn summary, AI is no longer just a theoretical tool in drug discovery; it's actively being used to design novel molecules, identify targets, predict efficacy, and repurpose existing drugs, leading to faster, more efficient, and potentially more effective drug development.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the **second development I mentioned: AI-Powered Target Identification and Validation.** This is a truly revolutionary aspect of AI in drug discovery, as it tackles one of the most fundamental challenges: finding the right \"lock\" (the biological target) for a new \"key\" (the drug).\n\nLet's delve deeper into what this development entails:\n\n**What is a Drug Target?**\n\nBefore AI, identifying a drug target often involved a lot of laborious, trial-and-error research. A drug target is typically a specific molecule in the body – usually a protein or a gene – that plays a critical role in a disease. By designing a drug that interacts with this target, scientists aim to alter the course of the disease.\n\n**The Challenges of Traditional Target Identification:**\n\n*   **Complexity of Biological Systems:** The human body is incredibly complex. Diseases often involve intricate networks of interacting genes and proteins. Pinpointing a single, critical target within these networks is like finding a needle in a haystack.\n*   **\"Undruggable\" Targets:** Many proteins involved in diseases have historically been difficult to drug because their structure doesn't lend itself to binding by small molecules or antibodies. These are often referred to as \"undruggable\" targets.\n*   **Data Overload:** The sheer volume of biological data (genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics, clinical data) generated by modern research is overwhelming for human analysis alone.\n\n**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**\n\nAI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at sifting through massive, complex datasets to find patterns and make connections that humans might miss. Here's how it's applied:\n\n1.  **Analyzing Multi-Omics Data:**\n    *   **What it is:** AI can integrate and analyze data from various \"omics\" disciplines – genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), metabolomics (metabolites), etc.\n    *   **How AI helps:** By looking at how these different molecular layers are perturbed in diseased states compared to healthy states, AI can identify specific genes, proteins, or pathways that are consistently implicated in the disease. It can detect subtle shifts that might be missed by traditional statistical methods.\n\n2.  **Mapping Disease Pathways and Networks:**\n    *   **What it is:** Diseases rarely stem from a single faulty component; they arise from disruptions in complex biological pathways.\n    *   **How AI helps:** AI can build sophisticated models of these pathways and networks. It can then predict which nodes (proteins, genes) are most crucial for disease progression and, importantly, which ones are most amenable to therapeutic intervention. This helps prioritize targets that are likely to have the biggest impact.\n\n3.  **Identifying Novel Therapeutic Modalities:**\n    *   **Beyond Small Molecules:** AI isn't just looking for targets for traditional small-molecule drugs. It's also helping to identify targets suitable for new therapeutic modalities like antibodies, gene therapies, and RNA-based therapeutics.\n\n4.  **\"Undruggable\" Target Breakthroughs:**\n    *   **New Binding Pockets:** AI can predict novel binding sites on proteins that were previously thought to be inaccessible.\n    *   **Targeting Protein-Protein Interactions:** AI is helping to design drugs that can disrupt harmful protein-protein interactions, a notoriously difficult class of targets.\n    *   **Epigenetic Targets:** AI is assisting in identifying and targeting epigenetic modifiers, which can alter gene expression without changing the underlying DNA sequence.\n\n5.  **Validating Targets:**\n    *   **Predictive Power:** Once a potential target is identified, AI can be used to predict the likelihood of success if a drug is developed against it. This can involve analyzing existing literature, clinical trial data for similar targets, and the biological plausibility of the target's role in the disease.\n    *   **Prioritization:** AI helps researchers prioritize which potential targets are most promising for further investigation, saving valuable time and resources.\n\n**Examples and Impact:**\n\n*   **Oncology:** AI is instrumental in identifying new cancer targets, especially in complex cancers or those resistant to existing therapies.\n*   **Neurodegenerative Diseases:** AI is being used to unravel the complex mechanisms behind diseases like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, leading to the identification of novel targets.\n*   **Infectious Diseases:** AI can help identify essential targets in pathogens (bacteria, viruses) that can be disrupted to create new antimicrobial or antiviral drugs.\n\nThis development is crucial because if you start with the wrong target, even the most sophisticated drug design and development process will fail. AI is significantly improving the *precision* and *efficiency* of finding the right targets, increasing the probability of success in drug discovery.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're asking about the key players in AI-powered target identification and validation within the broader drug discovery landscape.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer.

This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
